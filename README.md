# BitPairsClass
JSBitPairsClass and sample program

The JSBitPairsClass is a Clarion class loosely based on the FieldPairsClass that ships with Clarion. 

Instead of associating the values of 2 data fields, however, it associates individual bits.

Because of the somewhat similar nature to the BitPairsClass, I got permission from Softvelocity to post this.

This class is a simple way of doing the action of "Make this bit over here the same value as that one over there" without having to twiddle the bits yourself.

## Installation

Copy the JSBitPairsClass.clw and JSBitPairsClass.inc files to your Clarion\Accessory\libsrc\win folder. If you are using AppGen, be sure to refresh your ABC header files (or restart Clarion)

## Usage

Please see the demo program.
